Boris Bikes Challenge
=================

### Task

We were asked to write a program to manage the 'Boris Bike' network of docking stations and bikes for public use, created by Transport for London (TFL).

I aimed to complete this challenge by using a test-driven approach, using manual feature tests within IRB and automated unit tests using RSpec.

We were given user stories, which I first broke down using domain modelling. My resulting models were then converted into failing feature tests, then translated into RSpec as failing unit tests. Following that, I wrote my code.
